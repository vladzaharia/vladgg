**Hi, I'm Vlad.** I'm a 30-year old software engineer working on monitoring solutions for Azure customers. You can read more about some of the [projects]({{< ref "/experience" >}} "Projects") I have been a part of while on the Azure Monitor team, as well as personally.

In my free time, I'm an avid scuba diver and traveler, being Rescue Diver certified and having done dozens of dives around the tropical world.

Recently, I've become a dog dad to the amazing [Theo](https://www.instagram.com/theothethoodle) who is growing to be a good boy.
