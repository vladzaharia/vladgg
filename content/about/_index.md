**Hi, I'm Vlad.** I'm a 30-year old software engineer working on Azure Monitor's frontend to build rich, engaging experiences in order for Azure Customers to get an understanding of what is happening across their resources and applications. You can read more about some of the [projects]({{< ref "/experience" >}} "Projects") I have been a part of while on the Azure Monitor team, as well as personally.

Outside of my "day job", I am also the Director of Membership for GLEAM, Microsoft's LGBTQI+ employee resource group. In this role, I support over 3000 members across 50+ chapters around the world.

In my free time, I'm an avid scuba diver and traveler, being Rescue Diver certified and having done dozens of dives around the tropical world.

Recently, I've become a dog dad to the amazing [Theo](https://www.instagram.com/theothethoodle) who is growing to be a good boy.
