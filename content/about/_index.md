**Hi, I'm Vlad.** I'm a 31-year old software engineer working on Azure Monitor's frontend to build rich, engaging experiences in order for Azure Customers to get an understanding of what is happening across their resources and applications. You can read more about some of the [projects]({{< ref "/experience" >}} "Projects") I have been a part of while on the Azure Monitor team, as well as personally.

Additionally, I organize and run events for the intern and Early-in-Career groups within our organization, Azure Edge+Platform. I also was the Director of Membership for Microsoft's LGBTQI+ employee resource group, where I supported over 3500 members across 60+ chapters around the world.

In my free time, I'm an avid scuba diver and traveler, being Rescue Diver certified and having done dozens of dives around the tropical world.

Recently, I've become a dog dad to the amazing [Theo](https://www.instagram.com/theothethoodle) who is growing to be a good boy.
